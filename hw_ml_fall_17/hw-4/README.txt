I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, 
nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am 
involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form 
that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official 
university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 
for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive 
a grade of “F” for the course for any additional offense.

I have used sklearn library to implement LIBSVM.

rbf kernel, 0.7714285714285715
linear kernel, 0.8571428571428571
polynomial kernel, 0.7428571428571429

For choosing k we can compare different training accuracy for different
k. We can choose k which gives least training error.
