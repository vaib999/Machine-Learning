I have used python 3 for this project.
I have made separate files for stemmed document(stemmed folder) and for 
removing stopwords and then stemming it(stop_stem folder).

I have done this because by removing stop words and then stemming it is 
giving more accuracy.

I have included question2 written part in question-2 folder.

After removing stop words I am getting better accuracy because by including
stopwords the conditional probability of words that contribute higher
to classifiying ham or spam were reduced. So by removing them those words
had more conditional probability and thus helped in correct classification.

I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. 
I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and 
that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for the 
involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive a grade of “F” for the course for any additional offense.
