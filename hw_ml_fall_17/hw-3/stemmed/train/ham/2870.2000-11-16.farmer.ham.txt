end
of
month
feedback
from
unifi
bob
,
et
al
,
as
i
am
sure
you
recal
,
we
had
a
problem
with
sitara
posit
earlier
in
the
month
and
had
to
ceas
trade
earli
and
revert
to
cpr
for
posit
.
although
i
have
not
gotten
veri
far
in
my
transit
off
of
unifi
and
onto
sitara
and
td
,
we
do
see
some
potenti
for
thi
happen
again
toward
the
end
of
thi
month
and
the
begin
of
next
month
.
the
problem
with
manag
posit
is
a
combin
of
sheer
deal
count
,
along
with
updat
to
those
deal
.
a
larg
portion
of
these
updat
come
to
sitara
via
the
unifi
bridg
back
process
.
it
would
be
ideal
if
we
could
continu
to
have
the
unifi
data
"
clean
/
scrub
"
week
to
week
and
tri
to
avoid
have
the
bulk
of
the
month
be
updat
/
bridg
in
the
final
week
/
day
of
the
month
.
i
know
thi
is
the
goal
of
logist
,
but
i
just
want
to
help
reinforc
that
goal
due
to
the
perform
impact
it
can
have
on
the
ga
trade
system
.
perhap
a
few
extra
pair
of
eye
on
the
pipelin
except
summari
and
the
bridg
back
pipelin
summari
in
unifi
thi
month
would
help
.
anoth
area
that
caus
these
transact
count
to
increas
is
the
need
to
have
2
month
"
activ
"
at
a
time
.
in
other
word
,
when
novemb
is
over
and
we
are
in
the
first
week
or
two
of
decemb
,
sitara
continu
to
maintain
posit
for
novemb
.
thi
novemb
data
degrad
the
abil
to
updat
decemb
posit
in
a
time
manner
.
we
may
find
ourselv
have
to
remov
the
novemb
deal
from
the
sitara
posit
sooner
than
we
have
in
the
past
.
i
will
be
tri
to
work
with
the
sitara
team
in
the
come
day
/
week
to
implement
some
combin
of
quick
fix
,
as
well
as
look
into
the
long
term
chang
necessari
to
support
our
increas
trade
busi
.
pleas
let
me
know
if
you
have
ani
question
or
comment
in
thi
area
.
thank
