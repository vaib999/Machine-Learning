sorri
for
just
now
get
back
with
you
.
i
wa
out
last
week
.
the

(
$
.
04
/
mmbtu
)
will
be
charg
on
the
greater
of
the
volum
nomin
on

or
the

i
could
not
rememb
if
we
state
the
type
of
settlement
on
the
deliv
volum
(
actual
or
nomin
)
.
i
think
we
should
use
actual
due
to
possibl
that
the
plant
could
over
pull
with
out
our
knowledg
on
a
daili
basi
.
we
would
receiv
the
estim
/
actual
on
a
lag
and
may
have
to
purchas
ga
to
offset
the
imbal
,
even
though
the
plant
kept
the
nom
at
the
45
,
000
base
.
i
also
think
that
if
the
plant
doe
increas
the
nom
,
they
are
more
like
to
pull
the
addit
volum
rather
than
pull
less
.
do
you
agre
