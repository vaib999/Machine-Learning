that

and
have
notic
that
a
googl
search
yield
no
definit
answer
for
peopl
,
i
want
to
post
my
person
review
of
the
two
system
.
i
have
an
alpin
cda
-
7878
and
an
alpin
xm
unit
and
a
panason
siriu
unit
,
both
with
terk
antenna
.
the
alpin
unit
wa
connect
to
the
head
unit
via
an
ainet
cabl
and
the
siriu
unit
wa
connect
with
an
auxiliari
rca
adapt
avail
from

.
i
had
xm
sinc
it
debut
and
siriu
for
a
few
month
in
the
pacif
northwest
.
the
bottom
line
,
for
those
need
a
quick
answer
,
is
siriu
is
superior
in
sound
qualiti
,
featur
(
free
stream
from
their
websit
!
)
,
and
channel
qualiti
(
better
music
,
no
commerci
,
better
talk
)
.
xm
ha
a
few
more
channel
that
make
veri
littl
differ
to
the
end
result
(
read
on
)
.
after
care
review
of
both
system
,
siriu
came
out
the
winnner
,
as
i
have
said
.
the
channel
are
laid
out
well
,
lack
commerci
,
sound
great
,
and
are
stream
on
the
internet
.
the
onli
disadvantag
of
siriu
wa
it
oft
-
site
lack
of
nascar
,
which
they
seem
to
be
tri
to
remedi
.
also
,
xm
ha
an
extra
comedi
channel
(
it
'
s
bore
,
and
featur
older
,
censor
comedi
)
,
and
a
few
more
"
experiment
"
music
channel
which
most
will
find
total
useless
.
surf
xm
for
music
is
often
like

also
,
xm
'
s
channel
layout
wa
unfriendli
,
in
my
opinion
.
the
greatest
and
most
dizzi
drawback
in
compar
the
two
,
howev
,
are
the
staggeringli
stupid
and
annoy
xm
commerci

not
necessarili
the
corpor
commerci
that
come
from

compani
(
which
are
annoy
in

way
)
,
but
the
ridicul
and
loud

that
make
you
have
to
turn

quick
when

the

xm

howev
,
hold
their
own
and
can
satisfi
a
custom
with
some
decent
music
and
a
fair
select
of

.
if
not
for
siriu
,
i
would
have
kept
xm
,
i
think
;
probabl
becaus
it
is
nice
to
listen
to
the
same
station
no
matter
where

yet
,
as
