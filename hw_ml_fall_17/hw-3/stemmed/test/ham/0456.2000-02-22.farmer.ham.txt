hey
guy
,
just
want
to
make
known
my
concern
on
thi
issu
.
while
i
agre
that
howard
,
robert
and
georg
need
to
work
on
thi
togeth
,
i
do
not
think
that
howard
should
have
been
the
drive
forc
behind
thi
.
onc
we
left
the
meet
,
they
all
conven
on
the
37
th
floor
and
work
from
howard
'
s
desk
-
with
howard
sit
down
do
much
of
the
work
.
i
also
think
that
the
below
e
-
mail
should
not
have
come
from
howard
,
but
should
have
origin
out
of
the
logist
group
.
i
understand
that
howard
ha
prior
schedul
experi
,
but
he
is
not
function
in
a
schedul
role
now
and
bascial
took
on
that
role
in
get
thi
set
up
correctli
.
he
too
had
to
sit
down
and
tri
to
figur
out
what
need
to
be
done
and
set
everyth
up
correctli
(
?
)
.
in
my
opinion
thi
is
a
kudoo
for
howard
for
step
up
,
but
i
am
concern
at
the
role
that
he
play
.
team
effort
is
import
and
it
'
s
what
we
all
want
between
our
group
,
but
i
want
to
ensur
that
everyon
doe
their
fair
share
and
expect
are
appropri
place
.
let
me
know
what
you
both
think
.
thank
!
