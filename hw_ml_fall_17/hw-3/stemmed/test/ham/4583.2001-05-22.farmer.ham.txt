pleas
find
attach
spreadsheet
that
compar
hot
day
from
may
2000
and
may
2001
.
there
are
two
tab
,
one
tab
contain
the
day
may
16
-
18
,
2000
and
the
other
tab
contain
the
day
may
14
-
18
,
2001
.
each
tab
contain
both
the
load
data
and
temp
data
particular
to
the
day
in
question
.
the
day
most
directli
compar
are
may
17
,
2001
(
thursday
)
and
may
18
,
2000
(
thursday
)
,
although
the
two
day
preced
may
18
,
2000
were
slightli
warmer
than
the
two
day
preced
may
17
,
2001
.
the
peak
on
5
/
17
/
2001
,
44
,
923
mw
,
is
2
.
78
%
higher
than
the
peak
on
5
/
18
/
2000
,
43
,
709
mw
.
with
similarli
warm
day
befor
5
/
17
/
2001
as
there
were
befor
5
/
18
/
2000
,
the
peak
would
obvious
have
been
even
higher
.
thi
would
put
the
year
-
over
-
year
growth
in
excess
of
3
%
.
i
believ
thi
fall
right
in
line
with
the
growth
rate
year
-
over
-
year
from
an
earlier
analysi
,
somewher
in
the
rang
of
3
.
5
%
to
4
%
.
let
me
know
if
you
have
ani
question
or
comment
.
