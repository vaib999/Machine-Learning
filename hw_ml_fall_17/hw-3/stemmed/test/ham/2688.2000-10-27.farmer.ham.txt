i
understand
that
they
termin
their
agreement
.
howev
,
i
don
'
t
feel
that
we
can
confisc
their
product
.
we
need
to
either
pay
them
for
the
ga
,
or
cut
a
deal
to
redeliv
a
like
volum
to
them
at
anoth
meter
.
given
the
decreas
in
price
from
septemb
to
current
and
prompt
month
,
i
would
guess
that
they
want
to
be
paid
.
we
won
'
t
know
that
until
we
call
them
.
i
don
'
t
know
where
the
respons
lie
as
far
as
call
to
explain
to
them
that
we
took
deliveri
of
their
ga
until
the
meter
wa
shut
-
in
.
pleas
let
me
know
if
i
can
do
anyth
further
to
assist
.
