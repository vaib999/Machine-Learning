the
crm
databas
should
be
a
great

would
log
in

meet
and
ani
other
busi
that
get
discuss
with
the
custom
.
thi
would
have
been
a
great
tool
for
our

to
have
had
in
start
from
ground
zero
.
there
still
appear
to
be

that
may
not
includ
all
of
the

shown
abov
(
i

the
reason
that
i
have
written
thi

to
show
a
possibl
system
that
could
be
use
by
the
ga
floor
origin
and
trade
group
to
manag
contact
inform
and
share
data
among
group
.
the
cost
to
implement
thi
for
all
of
the
origin
group
doe
not
appear
to
be
prohibit
and
it
could
be
implement
in
a
good

some
of
the
issu
are
coordin
among
the
group
and
the
desir

.
let
me
know
if
you
think
thi
is
a
viabl
possibl
and
what
would
be
the
best
way
to
approach
