re

equistar
deal
ticket
i
need
to
have
these
ticket
set
up
so
the
excess
volum
will
be
price
correctli
in
unifi
.
current
unifi
is
ad
all
excess
volum
for
each
day
and
price
the
first
10
,
000
at
a
certain
price
and
anyth
over
10
,
000
at
a
differ
price
.
for
exampl
meter
1553
may
have
5000
on
the
first
,
meter
1384
may
have
5000
,
and
meter
1552
may
have
5000
.
unifi
current
price
the
first
10
,
000
at
a
certain
price
,
and
5000
at
a
differ
price
.
thi
is
incorrect
becaus
none
of
the
meter
exceed
10
,
000
,
each
meter
should
be
price
at
the
first
tier
level
.
robert
need
to
set
up
one
addit
sale
ticket
and
one
addit
buyback
ticket
,
but
he
will
not
schedul
ga
to
these
ticket
.
anita
luong
will
move
the
volum
to
the
correct
ticket
when
she
alloc
the
volum
each
month
.
equistar
receiv
manual
invoic
each
month
becaus
they
need
to
see
the
sale
and
the
buyback
on
the
same
invoic
,
and
they
also
need
to
have
each
meter
invoic
separ
.
i
need
to
have
these
ticket
set
up
to
clean
up
my
unifi
draft
invoic
.
